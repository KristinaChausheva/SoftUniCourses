"""
Write a program that reads 2 5-digit-integer numbers - the second one always being greater than the first one and prints
all the numbers in between them, separated by a space, that satisfy the following conditions:
â€¢ The sum of the 2 rightmost and the 2 leftmost digits of the checked number are equal.
â€¢ Or If the mentioned sums are not equal, add the middle digit to the smaller sum and check if the resulting new sum is
equal to the other sum.
    o If the sums are equal, print the number
    o Otherwise continue searching
